== Setting up

=== Downloading the application
.  You can download the latest version of `Codii` link:https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T17-B1/main/releases[here]. +
.  Make sure that the `codii.jar` is saved in a folder without any other jar files. This will be the `main` folder for your `Codii` application.

=== Loading the sample data
. Open up the jar file from the `main` folder.
. Log into Codii. Details on logging in, including a working sample username and password, can be found link:https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T17-B1/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#logging-into-the-address-book-application-using-command-line-interface-cli-code-login-code[here]. +
. You have to make a change to the address book to generate a `data folder`. Simply key in `delete 1` to delete the dummy contact inside.
. Exit the application by keying in `exit` into the command box.
. Within the `main` folder, there is a new `data` folder that has been generated.
. Within the `data` folder, replace the `addressbook.xml` file with the `sample data` file. Ensure that there is only one `.xml` file in the `data` folder.
. Rename the file to `addressbook.xml`.
