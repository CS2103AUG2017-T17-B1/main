== Setting up

=== Downloading the application
.  You can download the latest version of `Codii` link:https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T17-B1/main/releases[here]. +
.  Make sure that the `codii.jar` is saved in a folder without any other jar files. This will be the `main` folder for your `Codii` application.

=== Loading the sample data
[NOTE]
By default, the data stored in the `codii.jar` file already contains the sample data. The following steps will guide you in generating a fresh copy of the sample data
into the `Codii` application should the need arise. +

. Open up the jar file from the `main` folder.
. Log into Codii. Details on logging in, including a working sample username and password, can be found link:https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T17-B1/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#logging-into-the-address-book-application-using-command-line-interface-cli-code-login-code[here]. +
. You have to make a change to the address book to generate a `data folder` if you have not already done so.
. Within the `main` folder, there is a `data` folder that stores the data of all the contacts in `Codii`.
. Within the `data` folder, replace the `addressbook.xml` file with the new `sample data` file. Ensure that there is only one `.xml` file in the `data` folder.
. Rename the file to `addressbook.xml`.
