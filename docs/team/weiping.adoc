== Project: Codii
[https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T17-B1/main[Codii]] is a desktop address book application specially designed for debt collectors to manage debtors in a simple manner. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

Debt collectors can store information such as the amount owed, debt borrow date and debt cleared date in addition to debtorâ€™s personal information.

Unique features such as an interest calculator help debt collectors manage debts more efficiently.

Codii is evolved from [https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S1/addressbook-level4[AddressBook - Level 4]] which is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.
